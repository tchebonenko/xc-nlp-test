# Findings from Data Exploration.

### 1. Some paragraphs might be missing due to the current extraction process:
This might be the reason why In the data sample provided on GitHub (239 files):

* 36.82 % have only 1 paragraph.
* 19.67 % have only 2 paragraphs.

NOTE: There are files with an extreme number of paragraphs (more than 200 paragraphs in a file)

If we exclude files with an extreme number of paragraphs (more than 200) the histogram of the number of paragraphs is the following:

## 2.Very small % of paragraphs are duplicated within a single document

Although texts of those paragraphs are not identical, 98 out of 5,386 have >0.9 Jaccard similarity score based on tokens (text was split by white space to get its tokens).
 
NOTE: It might be the case, that some unseen symbols (like “white space” or tab etc.) make texts of those paragraphs not equal in symbol-by-symbol comparison, although for a reader they look the same.
 
*Process for Jaccard score calculation:* +
1.    For every document, get the text of one of its paragraphs +
2.    iterate through every other paragraph of the document +
3.    calculate Jaccard similarity score for each pair of paragraphs from (1) and (2) using the following formula:
 
*C* = intersection of unique values (sets) of tokens from paragraph (1) and (2) +
*U* = union of unique values (sets) of tokens from paragraphs (1) and (2)
 
*Score = |C|/|U|*
